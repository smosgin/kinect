    <title>Building Apps with the Kinect for Windows SDK</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Kinect enables you to light up and truly re-imagine how users interact with applications. Come learn about the Kinect sensor capabilities including how to read raw data from the Kinect, including color, infrared, and depth data. Then we’ll build on this to show how to use skeletal tracking, face tracking, and new features from the 1.7 Kinect SDK that enables developers to easily add click, grab, and drag gestures. You’ll also see demos from some of the most common tools used for Kinect app development including the OpenCV vision library and the Kinect Service networking library that enables reading Kinect data via Windows Phone and Windows Store apps. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:f1e2c1ffd07d40a2ac81a1c8010e239e">]]></description>

    <title>Towards a Lightweight Integration Bus</title>
    <description><![CDATA[We often see the term and architectural notion &quot;ESB&quot; showing up in customer engagements as well as RFPs. In some cases, we see them showing up in contexts where the goal is scale and availability on-premises as well as in the cloud. On the other hand, we've seen success with customers building their integration on top of a message bus where the integration workload happens at the end points, rather than inside a vendor ESB system. The goal of this talk is to highlight the paradox in using ESBs for large scale apps and to present an alternative in the form of a ‘Lightweight Integration Bus’ which is based on Windows Azure Service Bus. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:7bb914aec08944c2b975a1c7015483b9">]]></description>

    <title>Building a Scalable, High Performance Microsoft Private Cloud Using HP Cloud Solutions for Microsoft</title>
    <description><![CDATA[The HP Cloud Solution for Microsoft, most recently seen at the Microsoft Management Summit 2013 where it hosted the HOL Serverquarium, is the ideal infrastructure for virtualized workloads that will accelerate your journey to the Microsoft private cloud. Built on best-in-class HP Converged Infrastructure and Windows Server with Hyper-V and Systems Center 2012 SP1, we discuss: 1) How this solution was implemented at MMS 2013 and supported the creation and deployment of up to 8312 concurrent VMs across 30 HP BladeServers providing 277 VMs per server, 2) How management integrations enhance the capabilities of Microsoft System Center with server management, 3) How storage management integrations simplify the automated creation and management of LUNS on HP 3PAR storage using SMIS, System Center Virtual Machine Manager and Operations Manager, and 4) The implementation considerations, including design and integration points as well as options for support. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:a9480601faba428bbaaca1bf012877b9">]]></description>

    <title>Hackers (Not) Halted (repeated from 6/5 at 5pm)</title>
    <description><![CDATA[It is a hard time for penetration testers. Technologies are so advanced today, that we really need to struggle to do something malicious. We keep trying new tricks, and the system administrators keep adding new technologies to the field so that it is barely possible to fight against cryptography and new operating system security mechanisms. Fortunately for us, administrators are often very busy and security may not be their primary focus. Administrators' mistakes and people's misbehavior can be a great help to those who want access to a piece of information. During this session, learn the typical misconfiguration mistakes that can lead to some serious security issues and the same properly secured solutions and their reactions. If you care about security in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, this session is for you! <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:476127ff80634ceeb783a1bf012877a6">]]></description>

    <title>Understanding Dependency Injection and Those Pesky Containers</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Dependency Injection is one of those terms that advanced programmers throw out with an expectation and assumption of full understanding on the part of the receiver. However, I constantly get asked by attendees, students, and clients to please recommend a good DI product and show them how to use it; and when I proceed to start talking about the subject, it becomes immediately apparent that many don't even know what they're asking about. It's easy to get infatuated by a cool buzz phrase, specially when you hear so many others using it. But to truly understand something you need to start by understanding the problem spaces that it is trying to solve. So let's bring you totally up to speed then. In this session, I explain dependency injection from concept to implementation, and use raw code samples to show you how it works and what problems it solves. Then I get into what a DI container is and some of the characteristics of the ones that are out there, including MEF. I finish by showing you implementation examples in three different platforms. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:b2c4f5cbdcc04227876fa1b800d0dc67">]]></description>

    <title>Testing and Debugging Microsoft SharePoint Applications with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Visual Studio 2012 updates 1 and 2 have introduced a host of new capabilities to make it easier to test and debug SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 applications. In this demo-packed session, see how you can write unit tests for SharePoint which can run with the aid of SharePoint Emulators, without requiring a physical SharePoint deployment. Learn how to author coded UI tests which allow you to script tests which simulate users interacting with your SharePoint applications. Learn how you can compose web performance tests into load tests which can be used to test the performance and scalability of your SharePoint applications. Finally, see how IntelliTrace can be used to go deep into the SharePoint stack and understand exactly what’s happening when things go wrong. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:626f64b192de49f28052a1a2012e42a2">]]></description>

    <title>Exploratory Testing and Other Enhancements in Microsoft Test Manager 2012</title>
    <description><![CDATA[In this lab, learn about some of the improvements in Microsoft Test Manager 2012. Learn about how exploratory testing (also called XT, or agile testing) has become a first-class experience in the toolset. This allows a tester to more flexibly test the underlying software without relying solely on formal test cases. Meanwhile, Microsoft Test Manager will continue to capture rich diagnostics about the application being tested which can be delivered to the development team if a bug is discovered. You also learn about some of the other fit-and-finish features in Microsoft Test Manager, such as the ability to use rich text when authoring test cases. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:c0d04df39b8744e0aa9aa1960125b347">]]></description>

    <title>Managing Requirements and User Expectations in Agile Projects</title>
    <description><![CDATA[The only way to avoid requirements churn is to deliver requirements faster that your customers can change their minds. But Forrester has characterized most large software projects as “Water-Scrum-Fall,” meaning that today’s companies are good at coding incrementally, but this greatness is sandwiched between the waterfalls of Requirements and Operations. So, even when the development team can move fast, the rest of the organization can’t. It doesn’t have to be this way. By focusing on the two ends, teams can dramatically speed software delivery. This session focuses on the front end: working closely with stakeholders to rapidly identify, elicit and scope requirements, all while getting very rapid feedback throughout the entire process. Today’s powerful tools and techniques are bringing requirements work closer to development teams, providing spectacular improvements in delivery speed. This demo-heavy session covers the tools and techniques necessary to continuously deliver requirements. See real tools in action, such as UserVoice, inteGREAT, and the PowerPoint Storyboarding and Feedback Client tools which were both released as part of Visual Studio 2012. Additionally, throughout the presentation and demos, we’ll be tying the tool usage to the right processes to enable continuous delivery. Continuous delivery demands a great deal from your people, processes and tools. This session will help get you there. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:93d392cc74024d709918a1960125b314">]]></description>

    <title>HDInsight: Introduction to Hadoop on Windows</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Apache Hadoop is open source software that was born out of the large web properties need to process massive amounts of data. Now Hadoop is becoming the defacto platform for big data storage and processing in the enterprise. A modern Hadoop-based data platform is a combination of multiple open source projects brought together tested and integrated to create an enterprise-grade platform. In this session we review the Hadoop projects required in a Windows Hadoop platform and how it integrates with Microsoft SQL Server Database Platform analysis tools. We drill down into Hadoop integration and implementation Windows, Windows Azure and integration with the SQL Server Data Platform. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:1b7f6b6bdb994cd0a963a1960125b2bb">]]></description>

    <title>Developing Large-Scale Enterprise Mobile Apps for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Tablets</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Building a Mobile Enterprise Application Platform based on Microsoft technologies has never been more important. Enable your CIO to achieve one of their top priorities—extending critical data from your organization’s backend systems out to employee’s mobile devices. That data needs to be secure and easily accessed, even if offline. Windows Phones and Tablets are enterprise-class devices with the capabilities needed to make employees successful by creating an agile, real-time enterprise platform. With enterprise mobility markets reaching $174 billion by 2017, according to analysts, it’s time to take action. Let us guide you through all the elements required to build a powerful Mobile Enterprise Application Platform. Use Microsoft SQL Server 2012 and IIS as your mobile middleware where SSIS adapters aggregate data from multiple back end systems. Rely on the ASP.NET Web API to expose composite data via wireless-friendly REST &#43; JSON web services. Next, securely publish that data out to the Internet without the need for a VPN using UAG. Finally, your Windows Phone and Tablet Enterprise Apps will consume data and store it offline so employees can continue to be productive wherever they are in the absence of network connectivity. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:23bb667d3b0d47ebb8b1a19500768b78">]]></description>

    <title>All Aboard for the Future of HTML5 Mobile and Hybrid Web Apps for Windows Phone 8 and Windows Tablets</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Do you know how to bypass app stores and reach the fastest growing segment of the Internet while blurring the lines between native apps and the Web? What will Gartner’s prediction mean for us, that in just 2 short years, 80% of all mobile applications developed will be hybrid or mobile web-oriented? Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 rise to this challenge by including Windows Internet Explorer 10 with hardware-accelerated HTML and graphics, JIT-compiled JavaScript, enhanced security and great support for HTML 5. In this session, we show Internet Explorer 10 capabilities provided by the W3C WebApps Working Group including IndexedDB and Web Storage for offline data, Web Sockets for bi-directional communication, Web Workers for threading, and XmlHttpRequest for calling web services. Take your web pages offline with App Cache and make them location-aware via the Geolocation API. We show you how to do this as well as how to build hybrid web apps that run inside a browser control with full platform capabilities. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:d1c1a7771eaf4f9e85a6a19500768b65">]]></description>

    <title>Deploying Windows 8 to Bare Metal Clients</title>
    <description><![CDATA[The process of capturing and deploying an operating system in Microsoft System Center 2012 - Configuration Manager is fairly similar to that of Configuration Manager 2007. However, there are enhancements to operating system deployment in Configuration Manager 2012 SP1. In this lab, prepare your site to integrate with Windows Deployment Services (WDS) for use in a PXE deployment of Windows 8. Capture a Windows 8 reference system, then import that image into Configuration Manager 2012, and finally deploy it to a bare metal system. Also, configure the user device affinity relationship as part of the OSD process. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:719908fde2c1428d819fa19500768696">]]></description>

    <title>Pieces of 8: Prospecting for Windows 8 Gold</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Windows 8 is out, and there is a LOT to learn in it. Sure, everyone knows that it's downright &quot;touching&quot; in its new interface, but have you gotten around to building a simple Windows Store app and sideloading it? Taken the 2000 new Windows PowerShell cmdlets out for a spin to find the Twelve New Cmdlets You Can't Live Without? Constructed a Windows To Go USB stick... the hard way? Well, if not, don't worry—best-selling technical author Mark Minasi has been diving Windows in search of buried treasure since Microsoft's biggest OS shipped with Othello, and he's pulled plenty of &quot;pieces of eight&quot; from the latest edition. If you haven't had the time to crack open the new &quot;primary PC&quot; feature in Windows 8, then you're just leaving buried treasure in your infrastructure. Join Mark for a fast-paced exposition of the useful, the essential, and the fun. Don't you want to know what REALLY happens when you do a Windows 8 Refresh? Or how to build and easily deploy custom Start Screens? Sure you do... so we'll see you there. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:5493f3f0a6754c9b87e2a19500768590">]]></description>

    <title>Information Protection in 2013: Hybrid RMS, Generic Protection, and iOS/Android/WinRT Support</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Microsoft offers Active Directory Rights Management Service (ADRMS) in Windows Server today. Windows Azure Active Directory Rights Management is a new service from Microsoft that is tightly integrated with Microsoft Office and Office 365. These two services combine to support layered information protection offers such as: Office, Exchange DLP, File Classification, SharePoint Secure Libraries, and more. These offers support seven platforms with mobile applications, offer generic protection of all file types, business-to-business secure collaboration, and the ability to quickly deploy information protection services on-premises by leveraging cloud infrastructure. This hybrid offer enables HSM-based key storage, secure B2B collaboration, and enables your organization to maintain their documents on-premise if so desired! This first of two talks covers Microsoft's overall information protection offer as well as recent advances. Part 2 (Information Protection in 2013: Customer Readiness and Implementation Considerations) delves deeper into preparing for these offers as well as implementation considerations. Part 1 is a prerequisite for part 2. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:49abf33e91cb4d3b9bcda195007677c7">]]></description>

    <itunes:summary>Microsoft offers Active Directory Rights Management Service (ADRMS) in Windows Server today. Windows Azure Active Directory Rights Management is a new service from Microsoft that is tightly integrated with Microsoft Office and Office 365. These two services combine to support layered information protection offers such as: Office, Exchange DLP, File Classification, SharePoint Secure Libraries, and more. These offers support seven platforms with mobile applications, offer generic protection of all file types, business-to-business secure collaboration, and the ability to quickly deploy information protection services on-premises by leveraging cloud infrastructure. This hybrid offer enables HSM-based key storage, secure B2B collaboration, and enables your organization to maintain their documents on-premise if so desired! This second of two talks delves deeper into preparing for these offers as well as implementation considerations. Part 1 (Information Protection in 2013: Hybrid RMS, Generic Protection, and iOS/Android/WinRT Support) is a prerequisite for this session.</itunes:summary>

    <title>Implementing Self-Service Desktop Refresh in Six Easy Steps with Microsoft System Center 2012 SP1 - Configuration Manager</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Self-service? Desktop refresh? Easy? These are three terms you never expected to see together in a session description, and it wasn't too long ago that you wouldn’t. Today, however, System Center Configuration Manager offers to revolutionize how we refresh user desktops. The biggest facet of that change is enabling users to do it themselves. Accomplishing this requires a careful orchestration of OS deployment, drivers, updates, applications, configurations, and that all-important user state data. Microsoft MVP Greg Shields from Concentrated Technology has been automating desktop deployment since the very beginning. He’s also an automation master with Configuration Manager. Join him in this 75-minute power session and learn his six easy steps in completely automating one of the most time-consuming tasks in IT. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:2b4dc6ea98f5489c9240a195007677a7">]]></description>

    <title>Implementing Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0: Lessons Learned from a Production Rollout</title>
    <description><![CDATA[In this session we discuss real-life experiences and lessons learned implementing Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0 based on both personal observations as well as by supporting a TAP (Technical Adaption Program) customer who already rolled out in a production environment. This demo-rich session focuses on the key selling points for this customer and why they chose App-V 5.0 over a previous version for their 4000 seat VDI environment. It discusses the impact of migrating to this new platform as well as some of the pitfalls that were experienced during the process from both infrastructure and packaging perspectives. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:c381c5e8eb394002972fa19500767794">]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[You can solve slow boot and slow logon in your enterprise! In this (new 2013 edition) “Case of…” style presentation we share real-world examples and insider tips from Microsoft IT and other enterprises on the causes of slow boot and slow logon. We measure user productivity gains/losses in terms of cups of coffee consumed while waiting for PC, but your business could measure the impact in millions of dollars per year. Be the hero that saves the Windows user experience from heavy handed management layers and badly behaving apps. We are living through a competitive “Bring Your Own Device” era where businesses are re-evaluating management control versus user satisfaction. Now is the time to achieve the right balance and optimize your Windows experience at work. In this session MC Stephen Rose sets the stage, while Matthew Reynolds from Microsoft Services walks you through diagnosis of the most common real-world slow boot and slow logon issues using the Windows Performance Toolkit. We also go beyond diagnostics to share stories of enterprises working their way toward improvement and some of the non-technical challenges they have overcome. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:e2a85901fe23402cbf05a19500767773">]]></description>

    <title>Sequencing Applications Using the New Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.0 Sequencer</title>
    <description><![CDATA[This session covers how to sequence virtual applications to all of your environment platforms. This is an in-depth review of the sequencing process during which you learn how an application is transformed from an installed entity into a virtualized application using the Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 5.0 Sequencer. The session takes you behind the scenes to show you how to create the virtual environment for applications, define dependencies to a package, manage files in the Virtual File System and the Virtual Registry, and demonstrate how it relates to the Windows 8 OS. We demonstrate the use of Virtual Application Connections (VAC) and Virtual Application Extension (VAE) groups for managing application provisioning. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:e32d16e115264f7c853ea19500766f68">]]></description>

    <title>Getting to Know Windows Azure IaaS, Part 2 (repeated from 6/4 at 5pm)</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Whether you build apps or support the infrastructure that runs the apps, the cloud can be a really big place. For some, it’s a natural evolution for their application and infrastructure to embrace the power and scale of the cloud. For others, it’s a journey that has to begin with a single step. Windows Azure provides that first step with a scalable, flexible platform for deploying your applications your way. With our Infrastructure as a Service platform (IaaS) called Windows Azure Virtual Machines, you get the flexibility to choose between Windows and Linux with full control over the operating system configuration and installed software, matched with the portability of Hyper-V disk images. Windows Azure Virtual Machines provide the perfect environment for meeting all of your Infrastructure-as-a-Service needs. To learn more about our Infrastructure as a Service platform, we invite all developers and IT professionals to join Matt Hester as he introduces you to the Microsoft Cloud Platform, dives deep into Windows Azure Virtual Machines, and helps walk you through a hands-on demonstration of the power of IaaS on the Windows Azure platform. This is part 2 of 2. In order to attend this session you need to attend WAD-IL201 first. The lab requires you to connect to the Windows Azure Portal, where you will provision three separate virtual machines in the cloud and configure them each via a Remote Desktop client connection. All participants need to have access for Windows Azure prior to the lab. You can register for a FREE 90-day trial of the Windows Azure prior to the lab. You can sign up for your FREE trial here: http://aka.ms/IaasBootCamp. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:123736a1bf8e4e80b4aaa19500766d24">]]></description>

    <title>Windows Azure Web Sites and On-Premises Connectivity</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Windows Azure Web Sites is a great platform for hosting web applications and APIs written in Microsoft ASP.NET, Node.js, PHP, and Python. Customers who want to move into cloud technology a step at a time find great success when initiating their move to cloud by standing up their website presence using Windows Azure Web Sites. Many developers who aim to move to the cloud want to do so in phases. For these situations, many questions arise around how to connect a website back to an on-premises enterprise or even to connect to a Microsoft Office 365 site. In this session, various techniques of connecting a Windows Azure Web Site to an on-premises enterprise architecture are discussed. Through a series of deep-dive demonstrations using Service Bus, SignalR, data marts, and Windows Azure Active Directory, you are introduced to the opportunities that enable communication between Windows Azure Web Sites and your enterprise environment. If you've been wanting to get started with Web Sites but have been unable to conceptualize how you can set up a hybrid environment using Windows Azure, this session will clear the air and give you some ideas of what's possible. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:c8934eba988b43b3ab68a19500766741">]]></description>

    <title>Key Ingredients for Building Hybrid (Cross-Premises) Cloud Applications</title>
    <description><![CDATA[One of the key challenges for organizations wanting to move to the public cloud is determining which applications or services can be moved externally and which services are required to remain internal. The challenge frequently comes from not being able to determine how their application can leverage External IaaS, PaaS along with their private cloud resources. Let's face it, when it comes to applications there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. This session walks through a demonstration of a &quot;Hybrid Cloud Application&quot; scenario where Windows Azure IaaS and PaaS are leveraged along with on-premise resources. The primary technologies used in this demonstration are Windows Azure (IaaS and PaaS) along with Microsoft System Center 2012 - Virtual Machine Manager and System Center 2012 - App Controller. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:ab1d3adc089348fe9e66a19500766704">]]></description>

    <title>Database Snapshots with Microsoft SharePoint 2013</title>
    <description><![CDATA[Database snapshots provide a read-only, static view of a source database as it existed at snapshot creation. Snapshots can be used for reporting purposes, and in the event of a user error on a source database, you can revert the source database to the state it was in when the snapshot was created. Data loss is confined to updates to the database since the snapshot's creation. Also, creating a database snapshot can be useful immediately before making a major change to a database, such as changing the schema or the structure of a table. This lab introduces you to using Database Snapshots with SharePoint 2013. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:4dba3957f2e94a9cb889a19500766420">]]></description>

    <title>Creating a SharePoint App with Microsoft Access Services</title>
    <description><![CDATA[The new Microsoft Access has all the tools needed to get data-centric applications up and running quickly on Microsoft SharePoint in a professional new application interface without any development knowledge required. See how Access hides the normal complexities of creating a relational database (i.e., rules, schema, views) by having you just input what you would like to track and then launch a SQL-backed app on SharePoint. Users are able to view and manipulate the data in a completed device tracking app for SharePoint within a few minutes. You then build this same tracking app from scratch using Access 2013 with Access Services. Once complete, you will see your app running in a browser and be able to share it. &quot; <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:baf3e03cba064179a11fa1950076640e">]]></description>

    <title>Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Sharing and Security</title>
    <description><![CDATA[SharePoint 2013 introduces new sharing features that make it easier than ever for end users, with appropriate permissions, to share content with internal and (in Microsoft Office 365) external users. It’s more important than ever that you master the SharePoint security model, with its deep hierarchy of securable objects, granular permissions and policies, and interconnected user interfaces. This session demystifies SharePoint security by dissecting each of these components and presenting best practices for implementing and managing security. Learn how to effectively assign least privilege permissions. Discover under-documented “gotchas” of broken inheritance. Take away options for new permission levels and settings that address common business requirements. And learn when and why it makes sense to leverage Active Directory groups or use SharePoint groups. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:ae2d0098d7f84029886da19500765dee">]]></description>

    <title>Building End-to-End Apps for Microsoft SharePoint with Windows Azure and Windows 8</title>
    <description><![CDATA[With the deep SharePoint 2013 API set, coupled with the new app models for SharePoint and Microsoft Office, the opportunity to build innovative end-to-end solutions that span cloud services and devices is just plain breathtaking. SharePoint data is available via REST and SharePoint can fire events to light up your backend services—like sending notifications via the Windows Push Notification Service to SharePoint workflows. And all your cloud-based services can be powered by the reliability, scalability, and elasticity of Windows Azure, from websites to SQL databases. In this session an end-to-end demo is the backdrop for the discussion around the architecture and code needed to build just such a solution. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:ab99d1cb13aa49638096a19500765dac">]]></description>

    <title>Microsoft Lync Hybrid Scenarios</title>
    <description><![CDATA[This session examines the use of Microsoft Lync Online in a hybrid environment for user access, now possible with the release of Lync 2013 to Microsoft Office 365. For existing deployments, using Lync infrastructure already deployed, customers can easily expand their environment into Office 365. New deployments can also benefit by decreasing the on-premises Lync footprint and hosting users online. Benefits of using Lync Online in a hybrid configuration include being able to leverage global infrastructure to provide ease of access, a reduced on-premises server footprint, being able to consume cloud services at your pace, additional capacity on demand, and hosting users in highly available and secured datacenters. Lync Online through hybrid provides both a model for easy expansion and a model for cloud services at your own terms. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Session:RSSView:5b4dd45326c8479c94dca195007652b9">]]></description>
